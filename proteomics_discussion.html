							<h1> Discussion  </h1>

							<p>In this study, the primary aim was to utilise proteomic screening and pathway analysis to identify novel therapeutic mechanisms of placental stem cells combined with hypothermia in the context of neonatal HIE. A total of thirty proteins showed significant differences in expression, all of which were downregulated. Of these, seven proteins have previously been implicated in HI pathology, and 23 are novel. Over-representation analysis was performed on the list of proteins significantly altered between the HHV and HHS groups; results showed significantly altered cellular processes can be generalised into apoptosis-related pathways, cytoskeletal regulation, and inflammation cell-cycle related pathways. Additionally, stem cell administration was associated with significant decreases in TNF-α, NF-κB and Wnt signalling pathways.
							</p>
							<p>Few studies exist examining proteomic changes in neonatal HI models. Early studies utilised two-dimensional differential proteome analysis with mass spectrometry. Hu et al. <sup>1</sup> assessed changes in protein expression in P7 rat motor cortex 2 h after HI. The authors identified 17 proteins with a 2-fold or larger change in expression after HI compared with sham-treated pups. Of the altered proteins, the authors discussed 14-3-3ε and TUC-2, both playing an important role in developing the central nervous system, decrease after HI, consistent with an early disturbance of cortical development. Also affected, DARPP-32 and R-synuclein, two proteins important for dopamine neurotransmission1.
							</p>
						<p>	In 2008, Zhu et al. <sup>2</sup> used the same utilised two-dimensional differential proteome analysis approach to analyze the alteration and modification of proteins in neonatal mouse brain 24 h after HI treatment. Significant changes of collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) were observed in the HI brain. CRMPs are a family of cytosolic proteins involved in axonal guidance and neuronal outgrowth. They found that CRMP2, CRMP4 and CRMP5 proteins were altered post-translationally after HI injury. Mass spectrometric and western blot analyses detected hypophosphorylated CRMP proteins after HI. Analysis of CRMP kinases indicated the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a priming kinase of CRMPs and a neuronal-specific kinase that plays pivotal roles in neuronal development and survival. The reduction of CDK5 activity was associated with under expression of its activator p35. Their findings revealed HI-induced dephosphorylation of CRMPs in the neonatal brain <sup> 2 </sup>.
							</p>
						<p>	Rozenkranz et al. <sup>3</sup> aimed to identify proteins affected by HI brain injury in neonatal rats after 48 h using 2D-DIGE based proteome analysis. Calcineurin A and Coronin-1A were identified among the proteins altered after HI brain injury, showing higher expression in lesioned hemispheres. These are immune related molecules and signifies an upregulation in immune cell activity following injury and are functionally related to coronin 1B and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-alpha catalytic subunit. Both proteins found to be upregulated between P8 and HHV and rescued with stem cell treatment. Validation of the changes in Calcineurin A expression by western blot analysis demonstrated several truncated forms of this protein generated by limited proteolysis after HI. Further analysis revealed activation of calpain, which is involved in the limited proteolysis of Calcineurin. Active forms of Calcineurin are associated with the dephosphorylation of DARPP-32, an effect that was also demonstrated in lesioned hemispheres after perinatal brain injury.
							</p>
					<p>		Yang et al. <sup>4</sup> performed quantitative proteomic analysis was 24 hours after hypoxia-ischemia using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry coupled to label-free analysis. Compared to control, 193 proteins were present only in the HI group. In addition, 34 proteins were more than 2 folds up-regulated and 14 proteins were more than 2 folds down-regulated in the HI group. Gene Ontology database showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins comprised of mitochondrial proteins. Molecular function analysis revealed that the majority of proteins were involved in ion binding. Biological process analysis showed that the majority of proteins were involved in response to organic substance4.
							</p>
						<p>	Each of these aforementioned studies using proteomic techniques have contributed novel insights into the mechanisms and cellular processes in HI injury. Unfortunately, the limited number of identified proteins hampered mechanistic insights in the early studies. However, the paucity of studies indicates that proteomic analysis is an underutilised technique in the study of neonatal HIE. It is unclear why “-omics” techniques in general and proteomic techniques specifically have not been adopted by this field more widely as these techniques offer a more comprehensive picture of the state of the brain. Moreover, advanced bioinformatics techniques such as MINT and DIABLO offer integration across multiple omics outputs. The potential of these techniques are yet to be realised in HI models and examinations of the effect of therapeutic interventions.
							</p>
						<p>	The comparisons made between the P8 control group and the HHV group yielded 98 significantly altered proteins, the majority being upregulated in the HHV group. These included multiple proteins  that were significantly reduced in the HHS group including those involved in neutrophil degranulation (STOM, COTL1. FABP5, PTPN6, LAMP2, CYFIP1, GYG1), programmed cell death (H1.2, HMGB2, DBNL, PRKCD, PSMD13, PSMB2, PSME1, PSME2, PSMC5) protein polymerization (PRKCD, CYFIP1, HSPA1A, COTL1, DBNL, CORO1B) and TNF mediated signaling pathway (ILK, PSMB2, PSME1, STAT1, PSME2, PSMC5, PSMD14, HSPA1B, HSPA1A, ACTN4).
							</p>
						<p>	There was no overlap between significantly altered proteins in this chapter and the studies above. However, there are numerous differences between these studies which are important. Firstly, previous studies differed in sample preparation for example Hu1 and Zhu2 did not include lipid depletion step in their protocol and therefore some proteins remain membrane bound and be difficult to quantify leading to protein discovery. Secondly, all previous proteomics studies have been done in neonatal rats at 2 h-48 h post injury, rather than 7 days in the piglet, so there are both species and maturation differences. Thirdly, this chapter examined the difference between the healthy and HI injured piglets treated with HTH, previous studies did not include a neuroprotective therapy in their groups, just heathy or sham group and HI injured group.
							</p>
						<p>	To date, no studies have examined the effect of a therapeutic intervention on the proteome of a neonatal HIE model. One study has examined the effect of topical Baimai ointment, a traditional Tibetan medicine administered on the skin of the back, in a neonatal rat model of cerebral palsy induced by HI and intrauterine lipopolysaccharide challenge. Quantitative analysis demonstrated profound disturbances in the hippocampus and motor cortex proteomes post insult, in addition to the disruption of the motor system demonstrated by the rotorod test. Moreover, the topical application of Baimai ointment alleviated the motor deficit in the CP model rats and restored the proteomes in the brain cortex. There was no overlap between the top 20 altered proteins between this study and their study. However, the authors did not publish the complete list of proteins, so much of the data could not be examined. Despite this, this study remains the only study to examine the effect of a therapeutic intervention on a neonatal HI model <sup>5</sup> .

							<h2>Stem cell administration is associated with decreases in apoptosis-related proteins</h2>
						<p>	The apoptotic pathway activation has been extensively documented in multiple animal models of neonatal brain injury <sup>6,7</sup> . Apoptosis is thought to account for a significant portion of the neuronal cell loss associated with neonatal HI events; therefore, a reduction in the numbers of apoptotic cells or apoptosis-related proteins is frequently used as outcome measures of effective therapeutic intervention in models of neonatal HIE<sup>8,31</sup>. Here I found reduced levels of several proteins related to the apoptotic process, including NASP, H1.2, FUS, matrin-3, Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PP1, Ezrin. Reduction in expression of these proteins is in opposition to the observations of apoptotic cells labelled with cleaved-caspase-3 positive in chapter 5, though is similar to observations reported in other investigations of combined hypothermia and stem cell therapy<sup>28,29, 32</sup>.
							</p>
						<p>	Previous studies have shown reduced NASP expression was associated with globally enhanced chromatin accessibility, facilitating transcription release, and failure of replication initiation<sup>33</sup>. Kang et al. also demonstrated that NASP depletion led to a global decrease of histone H3K9me1 modification associated with H3 processing, which occurred directly at the promoters of up-regulated anti-tumour genes BACH2 and RunX1T134. This also resulted in a synergistic effect on reducing apoptosis with Myc and p53 decreases <sup>34</sup>. It is possible that the reduction in NASP could lead to a reduction in apoptosis by a decrease in H3K9me1 in HTH+SC treated piglets that should be investigated in future studies. Taken together is evidence of a new functional link between chromatin-associated proteins and HTH+SC therapy<sup>35</sup>.
						</p>
						<p>	The linker histone H1.2 is unique among the H1 members in that it regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis explicitly. Li et al. characterised a novel mechanism by which H1.2, but not other H1 isoforms, regulates DNA damage response and repair through the repression of ATM recruitment and activation <sup>35</sup>. They showed that upon DNA damage, H1.2 undergoes rapid PARP1-dependent chromatin dissociation through poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of its C terminus and further proteasomal degradation. Their findings suggested that linker histone H1.2 functions as a physiological barrier for ATM to target the chromatin, and PARylation-mediated active H1.2 turnover is required for robust ATM activation and DNA damage repair. Further research has shown that deletion of H1.2 has been shown to render cancer cells and mice resistant to DNA damaging agents 35,36.  Thus it may be that stem cells induce the more rapid turnover of H1.2 and allow more efficient DNA damage repair.
				</p>
						<p>	Oxidative stress induces DNA peroxidation and apoptotic neuronal death<sup>37</sup>. In the study, stem cell administration was associated with significant reductions in MATR3 and FUS protein. Matrin-3 is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein with wide-ranging functions in nucleic acid metabolism including gene transcription, DNA damage response, splicing, RNA degradation, and the sequestration of hyper-edited RNAs <sup>38-40</sup>. FUS interacts with Matrin-3 and is also thought to play a role in DNA repair, due to its ubiquitous presence at DNA repair sites41. Thus, downregulation of both proteins is evidence that stem cells may protect against cell death via an increase in DNA repair mechanisms as a response to oxidative stress.

						<h2>	Stem cell therapy was associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory signalling </h2>
							HI injury triggers the generation and release of damage-associated molecular patterns. I observed a downregulation in the expression of HMGB1 a pro-inflammatory signal in the HHS group compared with HHV group. Extracellular HMGB1 binding to its receptor leads to the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway, which is responsible for transcriptional induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and additional inflammatory mediators associated with the activation of microglia <sup>42-46</sup>. In mice, the in vivo microglial M1 signature includes genes responsible for an active protein catabolic process such as PSMC5, PSME2 and PSME1 and other PSME family members related to proteasome modulation <sup>47</sup>. In this study, I found reductions in PSMC5, PSME2 and PSME1 following combined therapy. Activated microglia then release several pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species that ultimately contribute to the ongoing processes of apoptosis. Therefore, the observation of decreased TNF-α and NIF/ NF-κB signalling is suggestive of an anti-inflammatory effect similar to that see in the experiments in a rat model of neonatal HIE treated with HTH and MSCs <sup>29,48,49</sup>. Consequently, the downregulation of NF-κB signalling is a favourable therapeutic outcome and reinforces our previous observations in chapter 4, and the observation of reduced NF-κB expression in a piglet model of foetal growth striction treated with combined MSCs and ECFCs – a more processed preparation of the stem cells use in this thesis <sup>50</sup>.

						<h2>	Stem cell therapy is associated with a reduction in cytoskeletal regulation</h2>
						<p>	Dynamic regulation of the cell cytoskeleton is critical in both normal function and regeneration from injury. During the early stages of development, there is the migration of radial glia cells and synapse formation and removal. In the presence of a HI insult, glial cells become activated with rapid alterations to morphology, including increased cell body size and retraction of processes, travelling to the injury sites, and removing cellular debris <sup>51</sup>. This analysis revealed several proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation, including α-Actinin, vinculin, Coro1B and Ezrin. α-Actinin and vinculin orchestrate reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton following the formation of adhesion junctions. A significant body of evidence suggests that vinculin's presence in focal adhesions is critical for integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. For example, cells devoid of vinculin have fewer and smaller adhesions and close a wound more rapidly than vinculin-positive cells<sup>52-55</sup>. Conversely, in vinculin-overexpressing cells, the number and size of focal adhesions are increased, and cell motility is reduced <sup>55,56</sup>. A reduction in the proteins that regulate these processes may indicate a reduction in cell motility, as would be expected in a reduced neuroinflmmatory state with reduced migration of immune cells.
				</p>
						<p>	Previous research has found that downregulation of Coro1B by siRNA increases PDGF-induced migration of smooth muscle cells. Researchers confirmed through kymograph analysis that the Coro1B-downregulation-mediated increase in migration is directly linked to increased lamellipodial protraction rate and protrusion distance in vascular smooth muscle cells. In other cell types, coronins exert their effects on lamellipodia dynamics by an inhibitory interaction with the ARP2/3 complex, which is disrupted by the phosphorylation of Coro1B. This is also seen in cells with reduced alpha-actinin-4. Williams et al. found that PDGF induces phosphorylation of Coro1B on serine-2 via PKCɛ, leading to a decrease in the interaction of Coro1B with the ARP2/3 complex <sup>57</sup>, and resulting in an increased in response to vessel injury in vivo. It is noteworthy that MSCs are known to secrete PDGF, so this decrease in it could be a direct effect of stem cell administration.
		</p>
							<p>Ezrin is an adapter protein that binds F-actin and DNM1 and, thereby, plays a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, in the actin cytoskeleton's reorganisation of cell projections, such as neurites,  neuron morphogenesis and synapse formation via its interaction with WASL and COBL. Furthermore, Ezrin may act as a common effector of antigen receptor-signalling pathways in leukocytes. Pore et al. demonstrated that conditional deletion of Ezrin in B-cells increases IL-10 production induced by TLR4 ligation. Loss of Ezrin in B cells results in dampened pro-inflammatory response to a sub-lethal dose of LPS in vivo, dependent on increased IL-10 production <sup>58</sup>. Currently, I do not have any data to infer any affect stem cell administration has had on IL-10 production. Future investigations into this set of piglets should examine Ezrin expression in combination with IL-10 production to confirm this relationship.
</p>
<hr />
						<h2>	Reduction in Wnt signalling</h2>
						<p>	The Wnt signalling pathway regulates crucial aspects of cell fate determination, cell migration, cell polarity, neural patterning and organogenesis during embryonic development <sup>59</sup>. In the context of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, Wnt signalling has been shown to inhibit oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation during remyelination in the adult rodent CNS60, and several studies show that Wnt activation inhibits developmental myelination <sup>61,62</sup>. Fancy et al. found that OPCs in hypoxic human neonatal white matter lesions up-regulated markers of high Wnt activity and lacked expression of the tumour suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) <sup>62</sup>. They also found that lack of Wnt repressor tone promoted permanent white matter injury after mild hypoxic insult. These findings suggest a state of pathological high-activity Wnt signalling in HI injured piglets sustained even after HTH treatment. Despite this data pointing towards a detrimental effect of increased Wnt signalling, it is also known that Wnt/β-catenin signalling is essential for the integrity and function of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB disruption is a key pathogenic feature of HI injury, including increased BBB permeability, micro bleeding, diminished glucose transport, perivascular accumulation of neurotoxic blood-derived products, and degeneration of pericytes and endothelial cells 63-65. It is yet unknown if the BBB is disrupted in these animals, though it may be an avenue of future investigation. Presumably, the BBB is less disrupted given the observations of reduced inflammation and general neuropathology in these animals, suggesting that the downregulation in Wnt signalling is cell type-specific, and would be better illustrated by repeating these examinations with cell sorted protein sample preparations.

				<h2>	Limitations</h2>
						<p>	As mentioned in chapter 6, improper representation of the target population due to low numbers and high variability led to us relaxing the thresholds of inclusion in the pathway analysis thereby accepting an increased probability of type I error. However, p-value distributions suggest the hypothesis tests were generally conservative. Furthermore, the observations from the protein lists and pathway analysis agree with the results presented in chapter 6, thereby strengthening our belief in this dataset. A limitation that needs consideration is the use of whole-brain tissue and not fractionated brain tissue, because this would reduce the masking effect highly abundant proteins have on less abundant proteins. However, such fractionation techniques commonly introduce sample–sample variability, and the bias introduced by such depletion protocols may outweigh biological variance, resulting in misinterpretation of results66. Further, these fractionated samples may be prepped for analysis of molecular modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, greatly enriching the biological information in the dataset and permitting the use of more sophisticated bioinformatic techniques. However, this approach would require a much higher number of animals and would be better suited to higher-throughput rodent model. Pathway analysis was conducted using human accession numbers. This decision was made because the protein network, interaction and pathway databases are much richer for Homo sapiens than sus scrofa, which often returned no results. Given the phylogenetic proximity of humans to pigs and that these pathways are highly conserved between mammals and lower vertebrates, this trade-off was acceptable. </p>
