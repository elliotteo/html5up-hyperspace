				<h2>Background: </h2>

				<p>	Newborns diagnosed with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) are treated with hypothermia therapy (HTH) to limit the progression of neurological injury. However, almost one-third of all babies treated with hypothermia for HIE suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcomes at 24 months of age. There is, therefore, a need to identify adjunctive treatments to boost hypothermic neuroprotection. The placenta offers a large exogenous pool of CD34+CD45- cells that can give rise to mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC), two cell types independently shown to convey neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in models of ischemia. I hypothesised that intravenous administration of freshly-sorted placenta-derived human stem cells (SC) would enhance brain protection (See Figure 1).</p>

				<blockquote>Objective: To assess the neuroprotective effect of HTH-SC compared to HTH alone on HIE brain injury, and the effect on markers of neuroinflammation.</blockquote>

<h2>Results:</h2>
<a href="Stem_cell_results" class="active"> For full results description see here. </a>
				<p>HTH+SC treatment was associated with reduced seizure activity and improved MRI and neurobehavioral scores compared with hypothermia alone. Combination treatment ameliorated neuropathology in HI animals as assessed by H&E staining with reduced neuronal loss. Morphological examination of the glial cells was suggestive of a reduction in neuroinflammation following combination treatment. However, no differences in gene expression of inflammatory markers were observed. Despite no difference in gene expression, differences between HHV and HHS were observed in the cellular localisation of TNFα, IL-1β and NFκB.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p> Combination treatment of stem cells with hypothermia lead to improved neurological and neuropathological outcome measures following HI brain injury, compared with hypothermia alone. Neurological and neuropathological improvements were associated with a reduction in the activation of astrocytes and microglia. These data support the hypothesis that freshly-sorted placental stem cells boost hypothermic neuroprotection, mediated in part by a reduction in glial cell activation, but the chemical mediators of these morphological changes remain to be identified. </p>
