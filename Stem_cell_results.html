				<h2>Animals</h2>
			<p>	Twenty-three piglets were used in this study. Two piglets were excluded before the administration of stem cells because they succumbed to the HI injury. A further five were excluded because they died before the experimental endpoint. No HHS
				animals in the HHS group died. This difference in survival was found to be statistically significant (see Figure 1). With all exclusions applied, there were four animals in the HHV (4 males) group and seven animals in the HHS group (3 males,
				4 females). Original experimental design had included a SHAM group to serve as a healthy biological comparison, though in initial experiments, one out of two of the SHAM piglets died before the experimental endpoint and both experienced
				clinical seizures following anaesthetic recovery. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the SHAM cohort's health, both SHAM treated animals were excluded from analysis, and future experiments were discontinued. To address the need for a healthy
				biological comparison, brains from five healthy piglets (2 males, 3 females) were obtained and culled at P8.</p>

				<h2>HI injury was equivalent between groups</h2>

				across the measured heart rate and blood pressure metrics, as well as arterial blood pH, lactate concentration (lac), arterial base excess (ABE) and HCO3-, and glucose (Glu) concentration.</p>

				<h2>MR Spectra outcomes following HI insult</h2>
			<p>	MR spectroscopy was measured and analysed from eight piglets, three from the HHV group and five from the HHS group. Due to the low group numbers and a true large outlier in the HHV group, it was inappropriate to use Welch's T-test and the
				Mann-Whitney U test was more appropriate. A significant difference was observed in NAA/Cho ratio (Mann–Whitney U = 10.5, n1 = 3, n2 = 7, P = 0.036 two-tailed; HHV, 1.450 [-0.6374, 1.947]; HHS, 1.947 [1.715, 2.392]). No significant differences
				were found for any other measured ratio (Figure 2). Out of the eight piglets that underwent 1H-MRS. Reliable 31P-MRS scans were only obtained for two pigs in the HHV group as
				respiration became unstable during the signal acquisition for the two other pigs in the HHV group, and they had to be removed from the scanner prior to completion of the acquisition. </p>

				<h2>MRI outcomes following HI injury</h2>
			<p>	One piglet from each group was excluded due to motion artefact, leaving three piglets in the HHV group and seven piglets in the HHS group. Due to the low group numbers and a true large outlier in the HHV group, Welch's T-test was
				inappropriate and therefore the Mann-Whitney U test was used. There were no significant differences in the mean T2 relaxation time (Mann–Whitney U = 10, n1 = 4, n2 = 7, p = 0.53) or ADC value (Mann–Whitney U = 4, n1 = 4, n2 = 7, p = 0.11)
				between HHV (T2, 75.76 [12.33, 186.30]; ADC, 317.10 [80.24, 754.4] ) and HHS (T2 71.65 [68.28, 75.10]; ADC, 290.5[273.1, 312.2]) (Figure 3).</p>

<h2>Neurobehavioural scores were imporved in stem cell treated piglets</h2>

<p>Neurobehavioral scores were decreased from 22 ± 1 in the HHV group and 22.00 ± 1 in the HHS group to 6 ± 8 and 17 ± 4 respectively at two days post-insult. Neurobehavioral scores were significantly higher in the HHS group on day 3 (HHV: 9 ± 8 vs. HHS: 21 ± 1; adjusted p = 0.044)) and day 4 (HHV: 9 ± 8 vs. HHS: 21 ± 1; adjusted p = 0.0311). There were no significant differences at any other time point.  </p>

				<h2>Neuropathology was imporved in stem cell treated piglets</h2>
				Observations of reduced neuropathology in the HHS group were complimented with immunofluorescence analysis examining the numbers of mature neurons with NeuN (Figure 4 A-C), degenerating neurons with FJC (Figure 4 D-F), and apoptotic cells
				with cleaved-caspase 3 labelling (Figure 4 I-J). Exploratory analysis of these immunofluorescent data showed significant deviations from normality and sphericity that could not be accommodated by data transform. Therefore, the data were
				analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test.

				A significant difference in numbers of NeuN positive cells were observed in FC between groups at p< 0.05 level for the three groups χ2 (2)=11.25, p=0.0002. Post-hoc comparisons indicate the median NeuN number in the P8 (979 [893, 1021]), was
					significantly different to the HHV group (703 [-53, 1163]; P8 vs HHV q=0.015) and the HHS group (849 [788, 874] ; P8 vs HHV q=0.19). Similarly, a significant difference between HHV and HHS group (HHV vs HHS, q=0.038) was found. No
					significant differences were observed in the PUT χ2 (2)=2.757, p=0.26. Significant differences were found in the number of degenerating neurons in the FC χ2 (2)=6.285, p=0.041. Post-hoc analysis showed P8 group (0 [0,0], mean rank=4.5)
					differed significantly with HHV group (26 [-21, 78], mean rank=10.75) and the HHS group (20 [2, 46], mean rank=10.07) (P8 vs HHV, q=0.057; P8 vs HHS, q=0.574). Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the HHV and the
					HHS group (HHV vs HHS, q=0.84). No significant difference was observed in the putamen χ2 (2)=3.359, p=0.1753. No significant difference in the number of apoptotic cells were observed in the χ2 (2)=0.9274, p=0.656 or the putamen χ2 (2)=2.70,
					p=0.2774. There was no significant correlation between the number of NeuN positive cells and cleaved caspase-3 [ρ=-0.200, p=.4564], or NeuN and FJC [ρ=-.4701, p=0.0680]. Colocalization studies demonstrated that the cleaved caspase-3
					positive cells did not colocalise with NeuN, Iba-1 or CD34, but predominantly colocalised with astrocytes. <figure>

						<figcaption>Figure 4: Altered expression of neuropathological markers in the frontal cortex of HI newborn piglets. (A-C) Immunofluorescent labelling of mature neurons using the neuron-specific nuclear marker NeuN in piglet brains. HHS
							brains displayed similar levels of mature neuron throughout the frontal cortex, while HHV consistently showed fewer neurons. Scale bar = 100 μm. Quantification found significantly fewer NeuN-positive cells in the HHV group (D). This
							reduction was in the HHS group in the frontal cortex(D), but not the putamen(E). Representative staining of degenerating neurons with fluoro-Jade C observed in both HHS, and HHV treated brains (scale bar = 100 μm)(F-H). No Fluoro-Jade C
							staining was observed in the frontal cortex of healthy controls (F). Quantification demonstrated regional differences in numbers of degenerating neurons (I-J). Apoptosis was observed by labelling cleaved caspase-3 and was uniformly
							distributed throughout the regions examined (K-M; scale bar = 50μm). Quantification by cell counting showed stem cells did not affect the numbers of apoptotic cells between the HI injured groups. Values are presented as median [lower,
							upper]. Statistical tests refer to Kruskal-Wallis tests with a two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli. Statistical significance was accepted at q < 0.05 (∗q < 0.05,∗∗q < 0.01, ∗∗∗q < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗q <
								0.0001). </figcaption>

								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p> Combination treatment of stem cells with hypothermia lead to improved neurological and neuropathological outcome measures following HI brain injury, compared with hypothermia alone. Neurological and neuropathological improvements
									were associated with a reduction in the activation of astrocytes and microglia. These data support the hypothesis that freshly-sorted placental stem cells boost hypothermic neuroprotection, mediated in part by a reduction in glial
									cell activation, but the chemical mediators of these morphological changes remain to be identified. </p>
