					<h2>Diffusion weighted imaging</h2>
					<p>Piglets were anesthetised with isoflurane (1-3 %) mixed with oxygen (2L/min) for the duration of the scanning protocol. Following anaesthetic induction, the animals were positioned inside the magnet bore in the prone position. A 150mm volumetric head coil was used to acquire sagittal, coronal and axial slices. Images were obtained at TR/TE 8500/60ms, 1.6mm slice thickness, 64x64 acquisition matrix. Region of interest was defined on the T2 map and applied to the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and raw values extracted.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left">1-H NMR</h2>
 <p style="text-align:left">1H-magnetic resonance spectra (MRS) were obtained on a 7T Bruker/Siemens whole-body scanner. A single spectrum was acquired 7-days post-insult in the frontoparietal region of the brain from a 10 mm3 voxel indicated in Figure 4.9 using single-voxel spectroscopy with the following parameters: TR=6000 ms, TE = 60 ms and 128 averages. Metabolite spectra were exported, processed, and analysed using the Advanced Method for Accurate, Robust and Efficient Spectral Fitting (AMARES) tool within jMURI and manually phased[309]. Before quantification, apodisation (10 Hz) was applied to the raw spectrum and Lorentzian peaks to were fitted to the corresponding N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho) peaks. Peak areas of metabolites were estimated using Lorentzian profiles and a priori knowledge with soft constraints (initial chemical shift, amplitude, and peak widths). NAA was set as a reference at 2ppm chemical shift. Peak area ratios were calculated for NAA/Lac, NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, Lac/Cr, Lac/Cho, Lac/NAA and Cho/Cr.  </p>

				<h2 style="text-align:left">31P NMR</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left">	31P-MR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 31P/1H 10mm surface coil. Phosphocreatine (PCr) was set as a reference at 0ppm chemical shift. Inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphomonoester (PME), phosphodiester (PDE), and the <span>&#945;</span>-,<span>&#946;</span>- and <span>&#947;</span>- phosphorus nuclei of the nucleotide triphosphate peaks were fitted to the spectrum. <span>&#945;</span>-ATP was fitted as a triplet,<span>&#946;</span> and <span>&#947;</span>-ATP as doublets. PME was subdivided into phosphocholine, and thioethanolamine and PDE were subdivided into glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE) glycerophosphocholine (GPC). Intracellular and extracellular Pi was measured as two separate signals. Then the metabolite ratios calculated PCr/Pi, PME/PCr and PDE/PCr. Intracellular pH was estimated from the chemical shift (frequency difference between the Pi and the PCr) MRS analysis general workflow is depicted graphically in Figure 4.10. Peak area ratios were calculated for PCr/Pi, PME/PCr, and PDE/PCr.
