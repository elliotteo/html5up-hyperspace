			<h2>Discussion</h2>
	<p>	Compared to the HHV group, the HHS group incurred lower mortality, fewer seizures, improved neurobehavioral outcomes, improved NAA/Cho ratio, a reduction in neuropathology and a reduction in glial cell activation. Gene expression analysis of several neuroinflammatory related markers did demonstrate differences between the treatment groups. Colocalisation studies revealed different cellular sources of TNFα and IL-1β between groups. Activated NFκB was colocalised with microglia in the HHV group, but colocalised with neurons in the HHS group. No significant differences in the EEG measures were observed. Both groups showed very similar blood chemistry and cardiovascular parameters throughout HI injury and throughout intensive care monitoring, giving confidence that both groups received equivalent HI insults.
		</p>
		<p>MRI, MRS and EEG are validated prognostic markers for long term neurological outcome in the human population, yet no consistent differences between groups with these measures despite significant differences at the microscopic tissue level. The one exception was that NAA/Cho ratio was increased in the HHS group compared with the HHV group. The synthesis of NAA, adenosine diphosphate-dependent, occurs in the neuronal mitochondria[368]. NAA is the acetylated form of aspartate and is highly concentrated in neurons and used as a marker of neuronal viability. The peak area is thus reduced in any process that kills neurons. Choline is a cell membrane component. The choline peak area is elevated in conditions with a robust immune response, as is seen HIE47,48.  Therefore, an increase in the NAA/Cho peak area ratio is consistent with increased neuronal survival and/or decreased immune cell response and supports the hypothesis that placental stem cells enhance HTH neuroprotection. One study found that decreased NAA/Cho ratio in posterior periventricular white matter was correlated with worse motor outcome in preterm babies at one year of age [369]. Zou et al. investigated the prognostic capability of 1H-MRS metabolite ratios in the era of HTH. Three peak area ratios revealed potential predictive values for adverse outcomes in HTH subgroup and combined results: NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho in the basal ganglia and thalamus, and myo-Inositol/Cho in cerebral cortex. However, with regards to NAA/Cho however there was significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 74% in the BG/T and I2 = 77% in the cortex). Moreover, the predictive value of NAA/Cho was not robust to sensitivity analysis. Therefore, the validity of NAA/Cho as a prognostic marker is questionable.
		</p>
		<p>Despite the improved NAA/Cho ratio, no significant differences were observed in the other ratios. This could be a matter of statistical power, as our group numbers were low and the values highly variable. Another possible reason for the reduced sensitivity of these measures compared with microscopy could be the differences in spatial resolution between measures. The quantitative measures of MRI were obtained using a 3D voxel in the parasagittal region of the frontal cortex, and MRS measures were obtained from a large voxel in the frontoparietal region. As the MR measures are an aggregation of the signal over the entire voxel, there may be signal contamination by CSF, grey matter, and white matter adjacent to these regions of neuropathological damage.
		</p>
		<p>Similarly, an EEG signal is an aggregation of the electrical signal over a wide area. This is important because the electrodes were positioned more laterally than where the most overt neuropathology was identified. Furthermore, the cortical neuropathology became more severe in the deeper gyral regions, meaning that the activity in the cortical regions closer to the skull contribute more power to the EEG signal. A study comparing the predictive power of EEG, MRI, and MRS found that thalamic 1H-MRS measures acquired soon after birth in neonatal encephalopathy had the highest accuracy to predict neurodevelopment two years later[370]. Given the success of thalamic MRS in their study, future studies utilising MRS may benefit from measuring thalamic MRS instead of cortical MRS as was performed in this study.
		</p>
		<p>Combination HTH and placental stem cell administration resulted in greater neuronal numbers in the frontal cortex in comparison to the HHV only group. In regard to the putamen region, given there were no significant differences between the three groups in numbers of neurons, numbers of degenerating neurons, apoptotic cells, it may be that the putamen was not sufficiently injured in our model. Basal ganglia involvement is seen in more severe cases of HIE[371]. It is possible the insults in this cohort of piglets were not intense to inflict sufficient injury, and/or the basal ganglia may have been adequately protected by HTH alone. Despite this, there were still significant upregulations of TNFα, IL-1β, CXCL8, and TGFβ in the basal ganglia of HHS and HHT, and significantly altered microglial profiles compared with the P8 group suggesting a neuroinflammatory response in the putamen. With that said, mRNA was isolated from the contralateral hemisphere and may contain white and grey matter from neighbouring brain regions (nucleus accumbens, globus palladus, internal capsule, etc.) and may not accurately reflect the gene expression in the areas imaged.
		</p>
	<p>Surprisingly, not alterations in cleaved-caspase 3 or FJC in either brain region. Studies have shown that cleaved caspase 3 is a poor marker of cell death/apoptosis and may reflect caspase's non-apoptotic functions[372, 373].  Acarin et al. analysed astrocyte cleavage of caspase-3 following excitotoxic damage in postnatal rats to determine if its presence is associated with apoptotic cell death, cell proliferation, or cytoskeletal remodelling[374]. They showed cleaved caspase-3 was mainly observed in the nucleus of activated astrocytes in the lesioned hemisphere as early as 4h postlesion and persisted until the glial scar was formed at 7-14 days, and it was not associated with TUNEL labelling. Furthermore, astrocyte caspase-3 cleavage was not associated with dividing cells. They suggested that caspase activation is critical for astrocyte cytoskeleton remodelling following cellular injury[374]. Increased cleaved caspase-3 expression, not linked with cell death, was observed in the contralateral hemisphere in a unilateral hypoperfusion P7-rat model[375]. Others in a similar HI piglet model have previously observed discrepancies between TUNEL-positive cell death and cleaved caspase-3 [376, 377]. Thus, supporting the proposition that much of the cleaved caspase-3 observed in this model is not a part of the apoptotic cascade but instead reflects astrocyte remodelling.
		</p>
		<p>FJC positive staining was highly variable within groups and between groups, with almost half of the piglets showing no positive staining in the regions of interest. However, positive staining was confirmed other regions on every section stained, thus ruling out the possibility of an unsuccessful stain. The mechanism of FJC is unknown, though it is believed to be specific to degenerating neurons regardless of the mechanism of cell death (i.e. Necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy etc.)[378]. It may be that by 7 days post-injury, most neuronal death in the more severe cases has already occurred and more consistent staining may have been seen had the experimental endpoint been 3 days. Wang et al. [379] compared diffusion-weighted imaging results with other common cell death markers at 24h post-injury in asphyxiated piglets. Their comparisons showed TUNEL assay (with kappa values 0.40–0.59 and P–values < 0.001) and moderate agreement for the Nissl and the FJC staining (with kappa values 0.60–0.79 and P–values <0.001). This suggests that FJC is an effective marker of neuronal death in HI injured piglets.  It may be in this study that the experimental endpoint missed the time window at which the maximal number of FJC positive cells were seen. This is supported by the observation that FJC positive cells at 24 hours were as high as ~300/mm2, in chapter 4 compared with a maximum of ~60/mm2, in this study.

		<p>An increase in microglial activation was attenuated in the frontal cortex, and astrocyte changes were ameliorated in the PVWM of the HHS group compared with the HHV group. In the context of neonatal HIE, these morphological changes are generally thought to be driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines along with glutamate, nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which collectively cause neuronal injury[91].  With the data generated to date, an anti-inflammatory mechanism is only supported by the associations with glial cell morphology. While trends were identified in our qPCR data, these did not reach statistical significance. Robertson et al., in a very similar study using newborn piglets to examine the effect of HTH+MSC therapy, saw no difference in microglial activation or GFAP intensity following combined hypothermia-MSC treatment after 3 days[276]. Rodent studies using combined HTH and MSCs showed reduction in markers of microglial and astrocyte proliferation at 42 days post insult [380-382]. These were associated with reductions in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-1α and IL-6. However, the results of these studies should be interpreted cautiously as when these studies were combined in a meta-analysis, significant improvements following combined treatments were only found in astrogliosis. No significant differences were observed for any other outcome marker (cylinder rearing test, rotorod, apoptosis and microgliosis). This discrepancy may be due to differences in the statistical approach used, as the individual studies modelled these outcome measures between 5 groups, versus comparing combined treated and HTH only treated groups as was done in Chapter 2.
		</p>
		<p>There was a clear difference in the localisation of NF-κB between HHV and HHS groups. The predominant source of NFκB in the HHS were neurons and microglia in the HHV group. NFκB is activated in the neonatal brain after hypoxic-ischaemic insult and has been shown to increase transcription of several major genes involved in inflammation, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and iNOS, that could contribute to neuronal damage[383]. It is commonly accepted that inhibition of NF-κB prevents pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thereby contributing to neuroprotection [384]. On the other hand, NF-κB may upregulate some antiapoptotic factors (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL), increase the expression of neurotrophins (e.g., nerve growth factor [NGF]) and SOD, and this can contribute to cell survival [385, 386]. For example, NF-κB is activated in CA1 hippocampal neurons in response to transient global forebrain ischemia in rats[387] and after focal ischemia-reperfusion in association with reactive glial cells in rats[388]. Such activation of NF-κB under adverse conditions may represent part of a stress response mechanism designed to help neurons survive the stress. Cell culture studies have shown that activation of NF-κB in neurons can be protective against the excitotoxic and metabolic insults relevant to the pathogenesis of stroke and traumatic injury (refs). When an NF-κB decoy DNA oligonucleotide was infused into the lateral ventricles of mice, seizure-induced death of hippocampal neurons was exacerbated, similar to the increased excitotoxic death of hippocampal neurons in p50-deficient mice. Hippocampal granule neurons in p50 knockout mice were also more vulnerable to death induced by chemical insult with trimethyltin[389]. More recently, it was reported that selective inhibition of NF-κB in forebrain neurons with a calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIα promoter-driven tetracycline trans activator resulted in increased vulnerability of the neurons to death induced by neurotoxic insults[390]. According to Nijboer et al., NF-κB can play a time-dependent specific role: the early post insult NF-κB activation contributes to neonatal HI brain damage, whereas the late action of this factor promotes neuronal survival through the upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules[391]. If this is true, it may mean that HHS treated piglets have entered this late action sooner, though with only one timepoint this proposition remains speculative.
</p>
		<p>This study, found an increase in the coverage of CD34 in the HHS groups, suggesting an increase in the total vascularity. This may suggest either post-HI angiogenesis or enhanced vascular protection following injury. As this was not a key focus of my study, I chose not to quantify other measures such as capillary length, branching or diameter; indicators that may discern whether increased CD34 coverage is due to increased formation of vessels or reduced loss of vessels following HIE. This finding, warrants a dedicated histological investigation examining the cerebrovascular following HI insult, accompanied with measures of protein expression of markers of angiogenesis, such as Tie2. Other lab group members have provided preliminary evidence of reduced blood-brain barrier disruption in the HHS cohort of animals, though this remains a qualitative observation. However, should this finding be correct, it would support the proposition that placental stem cells protect the neurovasculature, rather than improved angiogenesis. Grandvuillemin et al., 2017 also showed improved capillary density (eNOS) follow both UCB and ECFC treatment at 7 days and 12 weeks after treatment in a neonatal HIE rat model [172]. The authors also showed an increase in cerebral blood flow at 12 weeks for both treatments demonstrating evident functional improvement to the cerebral vasculature. Of note, CXCL8 is a potent angiogenic factor [392] that enhances endothelial cell proliferation and survival and that regulates angiogenesis[198, 393]. In Chapter 4 there were steep increases in CXCL-8, here there were difference between the HHV and HHS group in this study. Several independent reports have demonstrated that CXCL-8 stimulates VEGF expression via the MAPK signalling pathway[394, 395]. Zhou et al.[198] showed MSC treatment significantly increased the expression levels of CD31 and VEGF in the HIBD brain and promoted angiogenesis in the hippocampus.  No difference in CXCL-8 between the HHV and the HHS group may suggest differences in vascular coverage are not driven by CXCL-8.

	<hs>	Clinical relevance</h2>
		Despite an increasing number of currently initiated clinical trials of cell-based therapies treating neonatal brain injury, only a few pre-clinical reports have investigated combined stem cell-HTH treatment. Three rodent studies discussed in chapter 2 demonstrated similar observations to this study, specifically neuroprotection, reduction in gliosis, angiogenesis, and protection of white matter[201, 231, 277]. However, these studies were limited in their clinical relevance by the intrathecal delivery of cells. With regards to clinical translation, less invasive delivery methods are preferred. The aforementioned study by Robertson et al examined the difference between intravenous administration versus intra nasal (i.n.) administration of MSC therapy with HTH in the neonatal piglet (ref). They showed aEEG recovery was more rapid for the group that received i.n. MSCs with HTH vs HTH only group. The authors saw beneficial effects of i.n. MSCs-HTH administered at 24 h and 48 h (30x106 cells/kg total dose) based on more rapid aEEG recovery, improved 31P-MRS brain energy metabolism and increased oligodendrocyte survival at 72 h compared with the i.v. MSC group. The author's posited that the reduced effect from i.v. administration may be due to the unfavourable biodistribution of i.v stem cells reported in pre-clinical studies, with only approximately 2.5% of cells passing through the pulmonary vessels[396]. This could be a significant barrier to neuroprotection in our model. This observation contrasts with the widely held belief that stem cells are just as effective acting in a paracrine manner from distant tissues. Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that the dose used in our study was more than 100-fold lower than the dose used by Robertson et al.
		</p>
		<p>Another point of contention between researchers is the question of dose timing in relation to HTH. In a study using neonatal mice, HTH with delayed i.n. MSCs led to a worse outcome than either treatment individually[178].The authors posited that early HTH induced a long-lasting anti-inflammatory milieu which was detrimental to stem cell action. Indeed, brain levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were upregulated, and IL-10 downregulated in the combined treatment group. Expression of trophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, epithelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor were all reduced in HI injured animals receiving HTH+MSCs. Importantly, like the study by Robertson et al. I did not see exacerbation of injury, as in the mouse model by Herz et al. In Chapter 3 I showed that the pro-inflammatory processes have begun by 2h post-HI, this may act to heighten the antagonistic anti-inflammatory response of stem cells before the therapeutic effects of HTH are realised and may convey a beneficial effect.
		</p>
	<hs>	Exclusion and discontinuation of SHAM experiments
		<p>A string of adverse events in our SHAM animal group led our group to believe in a source of contamination somewhere between us retrieving them from Gatton and recovery from anaesthesia. Vet pathology confirmed the presence of Clostridium perforingens within the Gatton piggery. This prompted the suspension of further experiments until I believed I could either source newborn piglets from elsewhere, or that the infection had reached sufficiently low levels in our source heard to permit further experimentation. This led to significant delays in obtaining data for this project. While C. perforingens was identified in the herd by vet pathology at Gatton, it has not been identified in any piglets included in this study.

	<hs>	Limitations</h2>
		<p>This study was the first undertaken by our lab with a 7 day endpoint, previously the experimental endpoint was 4 days[303]. It may be that the beneficial effects of stem cells become apparent earlier when high rates of cell death are occurring 24-72h, or far later 2 weeks – 3 months. Protection after HI is related to the duration of cooling in preclinical studies[397] and clinical studies [349], and thus it's impossible to exclude the possibility of a different effect of 24 h of HTH versus 72 h of HTH in babies with neonatal HIE. I observed seizures in 3 animals in the HHV group and may have exacerbated brain injury, as prolonged seizures are associated with increased histological injury [303]. Given the large individual variability associated with this global HI injury model, having only four animals in the HHV group limit the confidence in group comparisons, especially because I expect the effect size to be relatively small compared with the effects seen in chapter 4. Additionally, it is well known that males are more susceptible to HI induced neurological injury than females. Data from preclinical studies show also that: 1) male animals are more susceptible to oxidative stress; 2) cell death is mainly dependent on caspase activation in female rats; and 3) the microglial response in the male brain is more pronounced during the chronic phase of inflammation compared to in females [398]. In particular, microglia are reported to have a sexual dimorphism in the neonatal brain in physiological conditions, with differences evident in microglial cell shape and density over time and in different brain regions [399, 400]. Given this fact, the unbalance of the sexes between the HHV and HHS groups may have influenced the final neurological and neuropathological outcomes. Additionally, as stated in chapter 4, morphological classification of microglia is an inherently subjective technique. Some automated tools for classifying microglia have been developed[335, 336]. These tools were not used here because they require the input of multiple Z-stacked images, which were not acquired in this study. An alternative method for quantification in the future would be to use a technique such as flow cytometry and classify microglia and other immune cells by surface markers. Lastly, this study was dramatically underpowered. Calculation of group sizes based on modelled normal distributions of our pilot studies concluded required a sample size of 8 animals per group (power of 80%) to detect a difference of 20%. Reasons for this included research delays due to questionable animal quality from our source, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to premature discontinuing of the current protocol, and modifications that made future experiments in our laboratory incomparable with this current dataset.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<hs>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>Despite low group numbers, this study's findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the combined administration of placental stem cells with HTH provides greater neuroprotection than HTH alone. The benefits of dual therapy may be mediated by a reduction in the glial inflammatory response, though I believe this neuroprotection may be multifactorial. More animals are required to increase the confidence in this finding and adequately assess the therapeutic potential of placental stem cell therapy and HTH for HIE.</p>
