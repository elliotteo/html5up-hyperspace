				<p>Background: Evidence has shown that combined hypothermia therapy (HTH) and stem cell therapy (SC) is superior to HTH alone. In the wider literature, stem cell treatment in the absence of HTH has been associated with various mechanisms,
					including angiogenesis, improved remyelination, reduction in oxidative stress, and neurotrophic
					effects in rodent and sheep hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) models. It is widely accepted that stem cells owe their broad therapeutic effects to their many secreted factors, the effects most of which have not been systematically
					examined. Thus, itâ€™s unlikely that I have identified the full list of therapeutic effects of stem cell therapies in HIE.</p>
				<hr>
				<blockquote>Objective: To quantify the whole brain proteome and use data-driven statistical inference to generate a list of possible therapeutic mechanisms. </blockquote>
				<hr>
				<p>Methods: The whole brain tissue was digested from the parasagittal region of the premotor cortex of 8-day old piglets. Each sample underwent information independent acquisition to generate a comprehensive peptide ion library. Brain protein
					expression was compared between HI injured piglets with combined HTH+SC treatment (HHS) and HI injured piglets that received HTH alone (HHV). A group of 5 age matched control piglets were included as a healthy biological comparison.</p>

				<h2> SWATH analysis </h2>
				<p>
					A total of 1916 proteins, all with greater than 99% confidence, were mapped in all piglets individually. These proteins were exported to PeakView for quantitation and further exported to R for group comparison and additional
					analysis. Following the removal of incomplete data, 1733 proteins remained. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the variance between duplicate samples, these ranged between 0.9979 and 0.9989. Due to the high
					correlation between replicates, the remaining analysis was performed with the mean protein level between the two duplicate runs. The differences between groups are described below. The histograms of the frequency of p values for the
					different comparisons are shown in (Figure 1 A-C). Groups did not cluster completely using principal component analysis (Figure 2A). PCA plots were then used to examine the potential for confounding factors such as Litter, Sex
					and Seizure presence. Piglets did not cluster according to these variables using the first two principal components and were therefore not included in the statistical models (Figure 2 B-D).

								<h2> Multiple comparisons </h2>
								<h2>P8 vs HHV</h2>
								<p>
									P8 and HHV groups showed significant differences in the MS response signal of 130 proteins, 98 of these showed > 0.5 log2fold change. 96 were upregulated in the HHV group and 2 were down regulated in the HHV group. Top 50
									significant proteins are shown in table 2.

								<h2>Pathway analysis:</h2>
								<p>
									HHV vs HHS
									Proteins with p < 0.1 change in expression and a log2 fold change> 0.5 were further analysed using over-representation analysis using the Gene Ontology and the Reactome databases. The decision was made to relax the statistical
										threshold from 0.05 to 0.1 because of the number of proteins < 0.05 was insufficient in many instances to return enriched pathways. Given that the study aimed to identify novel therapeutic mechanisms, I thought it was appropriate
											to accept an increased chance of false-positive results in exchange for a more extensive list of candidate mechanisms that can be systematically evaluated in future studies. The Reactome pathway database analysis showed
											apoptosis, programmed cell death, and a reduction in cell cycle-associated events, including Cyclin E associate events during G1/s phase transition, Cyclin A: Cdk2-associated events at S phase entry and G1/S phase transition
											were enriched (Figure 6). Protein-concept network plot reveals downregulation of all the component proteins. Top enriched pathways within the gene ontology enrichment were NIK/NF-kappa B signalling, axon extension and cellular
											component size, tumour necrosis factor-mediated signalling pathway and Wnt signalling (Figure 6). Concept network plot reveals net negative changes in all the component proteins in these pathways. </p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		While not without its limitations, this study indicates several therapeutic mechanisms, including anti-apoptotic effect and anti-inflammatory effect, as well as reductions in Wnt signalling and cytoskeletal activity in HTH+SC treated piglets
		therapy versus hypothermia alone. Wnt signalling has not been reported to be altered in stem cell-hypothermia combined therapies to treat HIE. The effect of stem cells on Wnt signalling and cytoskeletal regulation represent novel therapeutic
		mechanisms not reported previously in the literature as a mechanism of stem cell therapy and merits validation in future investigations.
