				<h2> Methods </h2>
			 Following moderate HI-brain injury, piglets were randomly allocated to two groups: 1) hypothermia-vehicle (HHV) group or 2) hypothermia-stem cell treated (HHS) group. Freshly-sorted placental stem cells (250,000 cells; 1:1 ratio MSC:ECFC) were administered intravenously 2h post-HI and immediately before hypothermia treatment. Hypothermia treatment (33.5°C) was maintained for 24 h, then animals were rewarmed for 10 h and weaned from anaesthesia. Heart rate, blood pressure, temperature and EEG were recorded for the duration of anaesthesia. Following recovery, animals underwent daily neurobehavioral testing. At seven days post insult, piglets underwent MRI and MRS before euthanasia. Brains were then extracted for histological analysis and gene expression analysis. The histological analysis included: neuropathological assessment with haematoxylin and eosin, NeuN labelling (neurons), Fluoro Jade-C (degenerating neurons), cleaved-caspase 3 (apoptotic cells), GFAP (astrocytes), and Iba-1 (microglia), CD-34 (endothelial cells), TNFα (pro-inflammatory cytokine), IL-1β (pro-inflammatory cytokine) and NFκB (transcription factor). qPCR was used to analyse gene expression of various inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, TGFβ) and chemokines (CXCL8, CXCL10), and one chemokine receptor (CCR5).

<h2>Statistical methods</h2>
<p>All analyses were completed using the R software version 5.3.2. Mantel-Cox log-rank test was used to examine the difference in survival between the two groups. Animals that did not make the 7-day experimental endpoint were excluded from further analysis. Initial data exploration was performed using the Shapiro-Wilks tests for normality and Levene's test for the assumption of equal variance. No deviations from normality were observed, but occasional deviations from the assumption of equal variance were observed between physiological EEG measures and neurobehavioural measures. So, Welches' T-test was used to compare group means between physiological measures, EEG measures and neurobehavioral scores; multiple comparisons were controlled for using the Holm-Sidak method. These data are presented as mean ± SD, as these are parametric comparisons. Significant departures from the normality and equal variance assumptions were observed in MRI, MRS, immunofluorescence and qPCR data. As this reduces the validity of parametric tests, these measures were analysed with either the Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis tests with a two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli. As these results are non-parametric, they are presented median [CI 95% lower, upper]. Statistical significance was accepted at q < 0.05, or p < 0.05 where appropriate. Figures were generated Graph Pad Prism 9, or IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27.0.
