								<h2>Systematic review</h2>
				This review was registered with PROSPERO July 2020 (ID: CRD42020196586)14; no deviations from the protocol were required. The following databases were searched by two reviewers (ET and LJ): the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE Advanced, Embase and Web of Science through to 9th of April 2021.
<hr>
				<h2>Eligibility criteria </h2>

				Studies had to meet the following selection criteria for inclusion: (1) non-human model; (2) contain a characterisation of the cell population or refer to a separate publication involving cell characterisation; (3) inflicted brain injury model must include a hypoxic component and ischemic component; (4) HTH treatment must be shown to be neuroprotective compared with NT (5) MSC treatment must be given immediately prior, during or immediately after a HTH treatment, (6); the MSC timing and dose were reported; (7) outcome was assessed through microscopic investigations and/or functional measures of brain outcome; (8) peer-reviewed publications in English.
				Screening and data extraction.

				Two reviewers (ET and LJ) independently screened titles and abstracts of the identified studies. Studies that met the eligibility criteria were subjected to full-text review. Assessment of potential eligibility and the subsequent data extraction was also performed by ET and LJ. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached. The screening and selection process was documented in a PRISMA flowchart15. All experimental outcome data were extracted, and the suitability of meta-analysis was prospectively determined.
				<hr>
				<h2>Quality assessment</h2>

				The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) ROB assessment tool was used to assess the ROB for the studies. The ROB assessment was independently performed by two reviewers (ET and LJ). Disagreements were resolved by discussion until consensus.
<hr>
				<h2>Synthesis of results</h2>
				Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models to generate forest plots. The summary measure was expressed as standardised mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or mean difference (MD) with 95%CI when appropriate. Statistical significance was accepted if a two-sided p-value was less than 0.05. The I2 statistic was applied to assess the statistical heterogeneity.  Calculations were performed in Review Manager (RevMan) [Windows 10], Version 5.4, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2020. The number of included studies was insufficient to construct a funnel plot and formal testing of asymmetry. Sensitivity analyses were not performed due to the low number of studies included.
