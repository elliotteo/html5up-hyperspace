				<h2>Experimental preparation </h2>
				<p> Piglets were sedated with 2-4% isoflurane (Bayer, Pymble, NSW, AUS) via a facemask and a Goldman Vaporiser. Piglets were then anaesthetised with a 5mg/kg propofol (Diprivan 1%, AstraZeneca Pty Ltd., NSW, AUS) injection through a
					cannulated (24 gauge) ear vein. Intravenous anaesthesia was maintained with propofol (9mg/mL) / alfentanil (50µg/mL) (Rapifen, ICI Pharmaceuticals, VIC, AUS) throughout the experiment. Anaesthesia was delivered at a rate of 10mg/kg/h until
					intubation with a size 3.0 or 3.5 cuffed endotracheal tube. Anaesthesia was then increased to 20mg/kg/h for 15 minutes, reduced to 15mg/kg/h for 15 minutes, and reduced again to 10mg/kg/h for the duration of the hypoxic-ischaemic (HI)
					insult. Following the HI insult, anaesthesia was adjusted between 4 and 12mg/kg/h to maintain sedation until euthanasia. Where possible, anaesthesia was kept at the lowest possible dose to maintain light sedation. Anaesthesia was maintained
					for the duration of the experiments. All piglets received a prophylactic dose of cephalothin (0.2 mg/kg i.v), gentamicin (0.25 mg/kg i.v) and penicillin (12 mg/kg i.v) 16 hours post insult.

							electroencephalogram (EEG) and 1-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) were acquired via the cerebral function monitoring system. Glucose and dopamine infusions were delivered via the mammary vein and propofol/alfentanil infusion delivered
							via the great auricular vein. Arterial blood was sampled via the umbilical artery for blood gas analysis. Temperature was controlled via an overhead heater until the initiation of the hypothermia protocol where temperature was
							controlled using the Tecotherm Neo (pictured Right). Tecotherm temperature control system was used to induce and maintain hypothermia return the animal to normothermia. Abbreviations: BP, umbilical artery pressure; CFM, cerebral

				<h2>Brain injury protocol </h2>
				<p> Piglets were stabilised before the HI insult for a period of 90-120min following the anaesthesia induction. FiO2 was reduced from 21% (air) to 4% to trigger hypoxaemia. The insult severity was titrated by manipulating the FiO2 between
					2-10% according to our decision tree (Figure 2). The primary goals of HI insult were to achieve low-amplitude EEG (< 5 µV for at least 25min), metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.1), systemic hypotension (mean umbilical artery pressure < 35mmHg for
						10min), and arterial base excess < -12 . Ischaemia was achieved by triggering hypoxemic cardiovascular de-compensation and decrease in MABP below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation between 35 - 45mmHg in the piglet. The HI insult
						was terminated by the return of FiO2 to 21%. This HI protocol is well established by our laboratory. </p>
