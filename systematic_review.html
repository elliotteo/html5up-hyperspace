							<h1 class="major">Do Mesenchymal Stem Cells Boost Hypothermic Neuroprotection?</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<a href="https://www.nature.com/pr/" class="active">Published in full at Pediatric Research</a>

								<h2 class="major">Context</h2>

							<p>Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a significant cause of death and disability in babies. The current standard of care, hypothermia therapy (HTH), offers only partial neuroprotection. Therefore, additional adjuvant therapies to boost neuroprotection and improve HIE outcomes has been a significant research focus.
							<p>MSC have been shown to protect the brain in animal models. However, when translating MSC therapy from the laboratory into the clinic, ethical considerations necessitate the study of MSCs combined with HTH. Therefore, the more clinically relevant question would be whether MSCs are beneficial in combination with HTH compared with HTH alone.
							<p>This question is critical to answer because HTH has the potential to alter MSC effects through direct effects of temperature, and through indirect modulation of the local tissue microenvironment. Thus, it is essential to systematically assess the effect of combined HTH with MSC therapy in animal models before attempting translation to human trials.  
								<h2 class="major">Objective</h2>

							<blockquote>To systematically review the literature to determine the effect of combined hypothermia (HTH) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy (administered during or immediately before or after HTH) compared with HTH alone on brain injury and neurobehavioural outcomes in animal models of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.</blockquote>
<hr>
							<h2 class="major">Results</h2>
							<p>Three studies met our search criteria. Meta-analyses of these studies demonstrated that combined HTH+MSC therapy favoured a reduction in astrogliosis compared to HTH alone. Measures of other primary (cell death, microgliosis, neurobehavioural tests) and secondary (levels of proinflammatory cytokines) measures were inconclusive.

							<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
							<p>This meta-analysis of published preclinical studies did not demonstrate a substantial positive effect of combination HTH+MSC treatment over HTH treatment alone for neurobehavioural or neuropathological outcomes. Future studies investigating the effects of MSCs in neonatal HIE must incorporate HTH, which is now part of standard clinical care of the newborn with HIE. Furthermore, future studies should utilise a reporting checklist such as the SYRCLE or ARRIVE tools. Lastly, a more focussed and coordinated approach is needed to understand the potential functional alterations that could occur, particularly when combining HTH with adjunctive therapies, to ensure robust preclinical evidence and to avoid possible adverse events when translating to clinical trials.
